        Hello all, thank you for coming to my website. It hopefully will be used in the future as a link to the rennekamp wealth management firm I will start when I am capable of doing so. I believe that it will be beneficial to me to show that I did something with my degree and will be able to use both of them. Not only financial economics but also computer science.
